# AGENT.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Documentation layout

When creating, renaming, or moving project documents, follow these placement and filename rules. Document content, language, and templates are unconstrained except for the work log's reverse date order and concise, readable entries.

After every project change or refactor, promptly add a separate document under `learn/changes/`, named `NNNN-YYYY-MM-DD-改造-中文主题.md`. Preserve existing records as snapshots of their time; editing an old record does not replace the new one. Navigation indexes and project explanations may also be updated where needed, but those updates do not replace the new record.

- Keep only the fixed entry documents at the repository root: `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENT.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Put project usage, implementation, testing, and security explanations directly in `docs/`, with lowercase English `kebab-case.md` names such as `sandbox-security.md`.
- Use `learn/` for project research, changes, bugs, plans, handoffs, and other project records, not just learning notes. Keep `learn/README.md` as its index and `learn/WORKLOG.md` as its concise reverse-chronological work log. Put other documents in `learn/reference/` (参考), `learn/reviews/` (评审), `learn/bugs/` (缺陷), `learn/plans/` (规划), `learn/changes/` (改造), `learn/handoff/` (交接), or `learn/resume/` (简历) according to purpose.
- Name files in those `learn/` category directories `NNNN-YYYY-MM-DD-类型-中文主题.md`, using the category's Chinese type shown above. Number from `0000` within each directory and use the next existing number for a new file. The date is the initial writing date; do not rename a file for later edits.
- At the start of a new phase or when the current plan is complete, promptly create a concrete next-step plan in `learn/plans/`; a verbal plan alone is insufficient. Do not reuse plan numbers present in `learn/archive/plans/`. Move completed or abandoned plans to `learn/archive/plans/` without changing their filenames. Fix relative links when moving a document. Create currently absent category directories when first needed.
- Before repository work, read at most the first 30 lines of `learn/WORKLOG.md` for recent progress. Read a specific active plan when executing or changing that plan. After completing work, update the log under the latest date in clear, brief language: what changed, the result, and the next step. Put new dates above older dates, and new entries at the top of a date's section; link detailed records. The log does not replace a separate `learn/changes/` record.
- `step/` contains tutorial code snapshots, `src/` contains product code, and `dist/` contains build output. Keep code-local explanations and test fixtures with their code; the project documentation naming rules do not apply to them.

## Read only what the task needs

`AGENTS.md` is the root instruction entry. Read sections of this file when their product details are relevant; files in `docs/` and `learn/` are not automatically required on every turn. Find candidate files by name or `rg`, then read relevant sections and expand only if needed. Use `learn/README.md` as navigation; do not routinely load entire categories, historical change records, archived plans, or the full work log. Reuse information already in context or a compaction summary before reopening files. General questions that do not depend on repository state need no additional project documents.

## Commit scope

For future changes, split commits into independent, reviewable units whenever practical. Keep the relevant code, tests, and new `learn/changes/` record together in each commit. Do not mix unrelated changes in one commit. State each commit's purpose and run the checks relevant to it before committing.

Windows is the primary development and daily validation platform. For code changes on feature branches, prefer relevant Windows checks; the default branch and manual CI runs retain Linux and macOS coverage. For documentation-only changes, check links, paths, and the diff; a build, tests, or a manually triggered CI run are not required. For mixed changes, choose checks based on the code affected. Run the full cross-platform gate at phase completion or integration rather than for every small commit.

## What this project is

Easy Agent is a **terminal-native agentic coding CLI** published as the `eagent` npm package. It installs the `eagent` command and the `easy-agent` long alias.

- Runtime: Node 22+, ESM, strict TS, target ES2022, JSX `react-jsx`
- TUI: React 19 + Ink 7 (no web framework)
- Package manager: **npm** (`package-lock.json` is canonical — no pnpm/yarn/bun lockfiles)
- Single-package repo (no monorepo)

The code is organized into five broad layers:

1. **Interaction** — Ink/React terminal UI (`src/ui/`)
2. **Orchestration** — multi-turn session flow, slash commands, usage/state (`src/commands/`, `src/session/`, parts of `src/core/`)
3. **Agentic loop** — reason → tool call → observe (`src/core/`, `src/agents/`)
4. **Tooling** — file/shell/search/web/MCP/local tools with permissions and sandboxing (`src/tools/`, `src/permissions/`, `src/sandbox/`, `src/services/mcp/`)
5. **Model communication** — provider profiles and streaming LLM I/O over `llm-bridge` (`src/services/api/`)

The numbered roadmap is complete through **Stage 36**. The `eagent` package is published on npm, and the post-publication registry cold check passes.

## Commands (the non-obvious ones)

There is **no** catch-all `npm test` and no lint/format script. Tests are smoke/characterization scripts wired directly in `package.json`; the release workflow runs the Stage 36 verification before publishing.

- **Typecheck:** `npm run typecheck` → `tsc --noEmit`
- **Build:** `npm run build` → `tsup` (outputs the bundled `dist/eagent.js` + sourcemap)
- **Dev (no rebuild needed):** `npm run dev` → `tsx src/entrypoint/cli.ts`
- **Start built binary:** `npm start` → `node dist/eagent.js`
- **Stage smokes:** `npm run test:stage20` … `test:stage36`
- **Release gate:** `npm run verify:release`
- **Domain smokes:** `test:queryengine`, `test:providerstream`, `test:notices`, `test:streaming`, `test:tasks`, `test:mcp`, `test:skills`, `test:sandbox`, `test:agents`, `test:filehistory`, `test:resilience`
- **Stage 24 sub-suites:** `test:stage24-md`, `…-clear`, `…-ui`, `…-ask`, `…-transcript`, `…-perm`, `…-stream`, `…-input`, `…-group`, `…-statusline`, `…-command`
- **Smoke aliases:** `npm run smoke:sandbox`, `npm run smoke:bash-sandbox`

For a smoke script not exposed as an npm script, run it directly with `npx tsx path/to/script.ts`.

### Script path inconsistency

Most `test:*` commands run files under `src/scripts/`, but **`test:stage30` is the exception**: it runs top-level `scripts/verify-multi-protocol.ts`. The top-level `scripts/` directory also contains `verify-*.ts` files that are not all wired to npm scripts; invoke them directly with `npx tsx scripts/verify-<name>.ts`.

## Gotchas

- **Two similar-looking config dirs are distinct:**
  - `.claude/` (`skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`) — Claude Code integration config
  - `.easy-agent/` (`skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `settings.json`) — Easy Agent's own runtime config
  Do not merge them or move files between them.
- **`step/` is intentional tutorial code**, not a build artifact. It holds milestone snapshots (`step1.js` … `step35.js`) that mirror implementation stages; do not delete or clean it up.
- **`dist/` is generated and ignored by git**. Rebuilding with `npm run build` replaces it with the single-file release artifact and sourcemap.
- **Secrets/config caution:** `.env` and `.easy-agent/settings.json` may contain local provider settings or secret-looking values. Do not copy token values into docs or output.
- **No `CONTRIBUTING.md`**; per the README, external contributions are not accepted yet, so conventions may shift.
- **Multi-provider model config** lives in user/project `settings.json`:
  - Anthropic provider names pass through directly
  - Other providers use `protocol` + `baseURL` + `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation for API keys
  - Relevant env vars: `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY`
- **Notable CLI flags:** `--print` (headless JSON output), `--plan`, `--auto`, `--dump-system-prompt`, `--model <name-or-profile>`.
