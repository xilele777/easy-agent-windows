# Easy Agent

An open-source, terminal-native coding agent built with TypeScript and Node.js.

This repository continues [ConardLi's Easy Agent](https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-agent) as an independent Windows-focused project. The original author and MIT license are retained. The published `eagent` npm package is from the original project; build this repository from source to use its Windows changes.

## Project status

**Current stage:** Stage 36 complete.

The implementation, tutorial article, and `step/` snapshot tracks are complete through Stage 36. The `eagent` package is published on npm under the `latest` tag, and the post-publication cold-cache registry check passes.

## Roadmap and progress

Easy Agent follows a 37-stage roadmap that builds the system progressively from model communication to distribution.

Stage 36 has passed local typechecking, bundling, tarball boundary checks, isolated global installation, installer tests, real PTY startup, `npm publish --dry-run`, npm publication, and cold-cache `npx eagent@latest` verification.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 22 or newer, npm, and credentials for at least one supported model provider.

Try it without installing:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token"
npx --yes eagent@latest
```

Or install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts eagent
eagent
```

The long command name is also available:

```bash
easy-agent --help
```

The original project's npm-backed installer is available for macOS and Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConardLi/easy-agent/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer checks Node.js, installs the same npm package with `--ignore-scripts`, verifies `eagent` on `PATH`, and does not install Node.js or run package lifecycle scripts for you.

## Model configuration

For a raw Anthropic model name, environment variables are enough:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514" # optional
eagent
```

Easy Agent also supports named Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Gemini, and local profiles. Put settings in `~/.easy-agent/settings.json` for user-wide configuration or `.easy-agent/settings.json` for a project:

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "gpt",
  "models": {
    "gpt": {
      "protocol": "openai-chat",
      "model": "gpt-5.1",
      "baseURL": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "apiKey": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
    },
    "gemini": {
      "protocol": "gemini",
      "model": "gemini-2.5-pro",
      "apiKey": "${GEMINI_API_KEY}"
    },
    "ollama": {
      "protocol": "openai-chat",
      "model": "qwen2.5-coder",
      "baseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

Select a profile with `eagent --model gpt` or `/model gpt` inside the REPL.

Project and local settings, including `.env`, are applied only after workspace trust. Interactive sessions prompt on first use. Headless commands ignore untrusted project configuration; after reviewing it, pass `--trust-project-config` to allow it for that invocation. Project environment values cannot replace credentials inherited from the parent process. See [Configuration trust and credentials](./docs/configuration-security.md) for precedence and migration details.

| Environment variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Anthropic API token or compatible gateway token |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Optional Anthropic-compatible endpoint |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Default raw Anthropic model name |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Referenced by OpenAI-compatible profiles |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Referenced by Gemini profiles |
| `WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` | Optional WebSearch provider key |

Run `/config list`, `/model list`, or `/doctor` to inspect the effective setup.

## Common usage

```bash
eagent                         # interactive REPL
eagent --model gpt             # select a model profile
eagent --plan                  # read-only planning mode
eagent --auto                  # classifier-assisted permission mode
eagent --resume                # resume the latest session
eagent --resume <session-id>   # resume a specific session
eagent -p "summarize this repo"                 # headless text output
eagent --trust-project-config -p "summarize this repo" # allow reviewed project config once
eagent -p "list the tools" --output-format json # machine-readable output
git diff | eagent -p "review this patch"         # combine stdin and a prompt
```

In headless JSON and NDJSON results, `total_cost_usd` is `null` when pricing is unavailable. Token counts remain in `usage`; `null` does not mean the request was free.

### Windows command support

| Feature | Windows behavior |
| --- | --- |
| File search | `Grep` tries `rg.exe`, then `grep`; install ripgrep for the intended search behavior. |
| Native commands | Use the `PowerShell` tool (`powershell.exe` by default, configurable with `EASY_AGENT_POWERSHELL`). |
| `Bash` tool | Requires a working POSIX shell; set `SHELL` when it is not available as `bash`. A WSL launcher alone may not be usable. |
| Command hooks | PowerShell by default; set `hook.shell` to `bash`, `sh`, `powershell`, or `pwsh` for each hook. |
| `apiKeyHelper` | Uses `SHELL`, `ComSpec`, or `cmd.exe`, in that order. Write the helper command for the selected shell. |
| Host sandbox | Not implemented on Windows. A fail-closed policy blocks PowerShell execution. |

See [the Windows workflow walkthrough](./docs/windows-workflow.md), [subprocess execution](./docs/subprocesses.md), and [sandbox limitations](./docs/sandbox-security.md) for details.

Run `eagent --help` for every startup option. Useful REPL commands include:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/help` | List commands and shortcuts |
| `/model`, `/mode`, `/think`, `/effort` | Control model and reasoning behavior |
| `/config`, `/status`, `/doctor`, `/context` | Inspect configuration and runtime health |
| `/resume`, `/history`, `/export`, `/copy` | Work with sessions and output |
| `/rewind`, `/diff` | Inspect or restore file changes |
| `/permissions` | Inspect permission rules |
| `/skills`, `/agents`, `/hooks`, `/mcp` | Inspect extension registries |
| `/plugin`, `/marketplace` | Install and manage plugins |
| `/memory` | Inspect or edit project memory |

## Capabilities

- File and code tools: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep, Bash, and PowerShell
- Web and external tools: WebFetch, WebSearch, MCP tools, and MCP resources
- Safe execution: allow/ask/deny rules, Plan Mode, Auto Mode, project trust, hooks, [controlled subprocesses](./docs/subprocesses.md), [private local data](./docs/local-data-security.md), and [fail-closed shell sandboxing](./docs/sandbox-security.md) on macOS and Linux
- Long-running work: TodoWrite, persistent task graphs, sub-agents, background runs, Git worktree isolation, and [Agent Teams](./docs/agent-teams.md)
- Context and continuity: [durable persistence](./docs/persistence.md), resume, compaction, token budgets, project memory, file checkpoints, and rewind
- Extensibility: skills, custom agents, slash commands, output styles, hooks, MCP servers, plugins, and static marketplaces
- Interfaces: interactive Ink UI, headless text/JSON/NDJSON output, images and screenshots, and multiple model protocols

## Upgrade and uninstall

Upgrade the global package, or re-run the installer:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts eagent@latest
```

Remove it with:

```bash
npm uninstall -g eagent
```

User configuration and sessions under `~/.easy-agent/` are intentionally preserved when the npm package is removed.

## Troubleshooting

1. Run `eagent --version` and confirm Node.js with `node --version`.
2. Run `/doctor` inside Easy Agent to inspect credentials, settings, MCP, plugins, sandbox support, and writable paths.
3. Run `/status` and `/config list` to verify the active model and configuration sources.
4. If a global install succeeds but `eagent` is not found, add the npm global bin directory associated with `npm prefix -g` to `PATH`, then open a new shell.
5. Report reproducible problems through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xilele777/easy-agent-windows/issues).

Never include API keys, `.env` contents, or private prompts in an issue.

## Architecture

Easy Agent keeps five runtime layers separate:

```text
Terminal UI
    ↓
QueryEngine (multi-turn orchestration)
    ↓
Agentic Loop (reason → tool → observe)
    ↓
Tools and permission enforcement
    ↓
Provider API and streaming adapters
```

Packaging is the delivery layer around those five runtime layers. The published npm package contains a readable ESM application bundle and source map. Its version-pinned sandbox runtime dependency supplies the platform helpers used for process isolation.

The implementation and tutorial snapshot series are complete through Stage 35. Stage 36 packages the CLI for distribution and completes the public documentation.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xilele777/easy-agent-windows.git
cd easy-agent-windows
npm install
npm run dev
```

Useful checks:

```bash
npm run verify:production
npm run verify:release
npm publish --dry-run
```

`verify:production` is the offline pull-request gate. See [Testing](./docs/testing.md) for the test inventory, isolated environment guarantees, platform checks, and explicit live tests.

The main source lives under `src/`; milestone snapshots live under `step/`. Build output under `dist/` is generated and ignored by Git.
